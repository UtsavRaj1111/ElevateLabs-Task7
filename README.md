# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification â€“ Breast Cancer Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates binary classification using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.  
It covers **linear** and **non-linear (RBF)** kernels, includes **hyperparameter tuning** with cross-validation, and provides **decision boundary visualizations**.  
The workflow involves loading data, preprocessing, training, evaluating, and tuning models.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Load and preprocess the Breast Cancer dataset
- Train **Linear SVM** and **RBF SVM** models
- Standardize features for optimal performance
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Generate accuracy scores and classification reports
